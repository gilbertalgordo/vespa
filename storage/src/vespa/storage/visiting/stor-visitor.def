## The number of buckets that are visited in parallel in a visitor visiting
## multiple buckets. Default is 8, meaning if you send a create visitor to visit
## 100 buckets, 8 of them will be visited in parallel.

## Max concurrent visitors (legacy)

## Priority-based max concurrent visitors. Fixed is the total number of
## concurrent visitors that can run for any priorities. Variable
## increases the concurrency limit for higher priorities, the limit
## being linear with a messages priority. Example: if Fixed is 16
## and Variable is 64, maxconcurrent for a pri 255 message is 16 and
## maxconcurrent for a pri 0 message is 16+64=80.
## If fixed is left as 0, it will take the value of maxconcurrentvisitors,
## allowing backwards compatability

# Limit of memory used _per visitor_ in bytes.
# Due to optimistic parallelization, it is possible for this limit to be
# initially violated when the visitor is first started. This can happen since
# the visitor does not know the size of the bucket contents before fetching
# any data from it and it will do so based on parallelization factors specified
# in the CreateVisitor command. If 3 buckets are initially visited in parallel
# and these both contain a single 100 MiB document, the memory usage of the
# visitor will peak at 300 MiB even if the configured limit is e.g. 20 MiB.
# Default value is set to 20 MiB, which attempts to keep a reasonably safe
# level in the face of a default number of max concurrent visitors (64).
