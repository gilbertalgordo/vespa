/**
 * Levenshtein Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
 *
 * The Levenshtein distance (or edit distance) is the minimum number of edits (additions,
 * deletions or substitutions) needed to transform a particular source string s to a
 * particular target string t.
 *
 * Let m be the length of the source string and n be the length of the target string.
 *
 * The classic dynamic programming algorithm uses a n x m cost matrix and is therefore
 * O(nm) in space and time. By observing that only 2 rows of the matrix are actually
 * needed, this is commonly reduced to O(n) space complexity (still O(nm) time complexity).
 * When the maximum number of allowed edits is constrained to k, some clever observations
 * about the nature of the cost matrix allows for reducing the time complexity down to
 * O(kn) (more specifically, O((2k+1) * n)). When k is fixed (e.g. k in {1, 2}), the
 * time complexity simplifies down to O(n).
 *
 * This implements code for building and evaluating Levenshtein Deterministic Finite
 * Automata, where the resulting DFA efficiently matches all possible source strings that
 * can be transformed to the target string within k max edits. This allows for easy linear
 * matching of strings.
 *
 * Inspiration:
 *   - http://blog.notdot.net/2010/07/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Levenshtein-Automata
 *   - https://julesjacobs.com/2015/06/17/disqus-levenshtein-simple-and-fast.html
 *
 * The latter in particular was a close inspiration for the sparse DFA state management.
 *
 * ====== Dictionary skipping via successor string generation ======
 *
 * Scanning for edit distance matches frequently takes place against a sorted dictionary.
 * When matching using a DFA, in the case where the source string does _not_ match, we can
 * generate the _successor_ string; the next matching string that is lexicographically
 * _greater_ than the source string. This string has the invariant that there are no
 * possibly matching strings within k edits ordered after the source string but before
 * the successor.
 *
 * This lets us do possibly massive leaps forward in the dictionary, turning a dictionary
 * scan into a sublinear operation.
 *
 * Note that the implemented successor algorithm is slightly different from that described
 * in the above blog post. The implemented algorithm requires zero extra data structures
 * than the DFA itself and the target string and tries to be extra clever with reducing
 * the number of code point conversions required
 *
 * ====== Unicode support ======
 *
 * Matching and successor generation is fully Unicode-aware. All input strings are expected
 * to be in UTF-8, and the generated successor is encoded as UTF-8 (with some caveats; see
 * the documentation for match()) or UTF-32, depending on the chosen `match()` overload.
 *
 * Internally, matching is done on UTF-32 code points and the DFA itself is built around
 * UTF-32. This is unlike Lucene, which converts a UTF-32 DFA to an equivalent UTF-8 DFA.
 *
 * ====== Memory usage ======
 *
 * There is always a baseline DFA memory usage O(n) in the target string, as the
 * underlying DFA needs to convert the input UTF-8 string to explicit UTF-32 chars.
 *
 * Aside from the baseline, memory usage depends on whether an explicit or implicit DFA
 * is used.
 *
 * ------ Explicit DFA ------
 *
 * The explicit DFA graph takes up quite a bit more memory than the original string
 * representation (one reason is the use of UTF-32 characters under the hood).
 *
 * Expected upper bound memory usage for a string of length n with max edits k is
 *
 *   (2k+1) * N(k) * n * W(k)
 *
 * where N(1) is expected to be 32 and N(2) is 48, W(1) is 1.34 and W(2) is 3.2 (empirically
 * derived).
 *
 * Memory usage during building is higher due to keeping track of the set of generated
 * states in a hash table, but still linear in input size. This extra memory is freed
 * once building is complete.
 *
 * ------ Implicit DFA ------
 *
 * Implicit DFAs have a O(1) memory usage during evaluation, which all lives on the stack
 * or in registers (this does not include the successor string, which is provided by the
 * caller).
 *
 * Since the sparse state stepping is currently not as fast as explicit DFA node traversal,
 * string matching is slower than with the explicit DFA.
 *
 * ====== In short ======
 *
 *  - Immutable; build once, run many times.
 *  - Explicit DFA build time is amortized linear in target string size.
 *  - Implicit DFA build time is O(1) (aside from initial UTF-32 conversion)
 *  - Zero-allocation matching.
 *  - Matching takes in raw UTF-8 input, no need to pre-convert.
 *    - Streaming UTF-8 to UTF-32 conversion; fully unicode-aware (DFA uses UTF-32 code
 *      points internally).
 *    - If required, it's possible (but not currently implemented) to bake case
 *      insensitive matching semantics into the generated DFA itself.
 *  - Allows for dictionary forward-skipping via successor algorithm.
 *  - Amortized zero allocations for successor string building when reusing string
 *    between matches.
 *  - Successor string is generated in-place as UTF-8 and can be directly used as input
 *    to a byte-wise dictionary seek.

     *
     * In the case of a _match_, the following holds:
     *
     *   - The returned MatchResult has the same semantics as `match(source)`.
     *   - `successor_out` has a _prefix_ equal to its value that was originally passed
     *     in at the time of match() being called. The _suffix_ of the string is unspecified,
     *     i.e. it may or may not have been modified.
     *
     * In the case of a _mismatch_, the following holds:
     *
     *   - `successor_out` has a _prefix_ equal to its value that was originally passed
     *      in at the time of match() being called.
     *   - `successor_out` has a _suffix_ that contains the next (in byte-wise ordering)
     *     possible _matching_ string S so that there exists no other matching string S'
     *     that is greater than `source` but smaller than S.
     *     The caller must explicitly be aware of any prefixes it sends in, as it is
     *     entirely ignored for the purposes of ordering the successor string vis-a-vis
     *     the input source string.
     *   - `successor_out` contains UTF-8 bytes that are within what UTF-8 can legally
     *     encode in bitwise form, but the _code points_ they encode may not be valid.
     *     In particular, surrogate pair ranges and U+10FFFF+1 may be encoded, neither of
     *     which are valid UTF-8.
     *
     * It is expected that the consumer of `successor_out` is only interested in the
     * memcmp()-ordering of strings and not whether they are technically valid Unicode.
     * This should be the case for low-level dictionary data structures etc.

     * Ordering notes: when the DFA is created as Uncased, the target and source strings
     * are treated as lowercase when matching. The successor string is in this case generated
     * _as if_ the input source string was originally lowercase. This is a special case
     * intended for case-folded dictionaries that implicitly order strings by their lowercased
     * form, but where they are stored in their original cased form. The (raw) cased form
     * is what is passed to the DFA match() function.
     *
     * Memory allocation:
     * This function does not directly or indirectly allocate any heap memory if the
     * `successor_out` string provided is large enough to fit any generated successor.
     * By reusing the successor string across many calls, this therefore amortizes memory
     * allocations down to near zero per invocation.
